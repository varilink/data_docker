# NOTE: Latest image version used and not version to match nginx in live
# The nginx official Docker image supports the use of environment variables in
# the nginx configuration, which I use in this repository - see
# https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx. However this features is new in version 1.19
# of the Docker image and the nginx version currently in use in live is 1.10.3,
# so I'm not matching the live version here.
