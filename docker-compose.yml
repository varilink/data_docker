  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Services that combine to run the DATA website on the developer desktop.
  # These are:
  #  1. web service
  #  2. app service
  #  3. admin service
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # 1. web service
  # --------------

  web:

    build: ./web

    image: varilink/data/web

    container_name: ${DATA_WEB_HOST} # fixed for varilink/tools-proxy access

    # See the .env file for explanatory comments on all these variables
    environment:
      - DATA_WEB_HOST
      - DATA_APP_HOST
      - DATA_APP_PORT
      - DATA_ADMIN_HOST
      - DATA_ADMIN_PORT

    # The web layer passes requests through to the app and admin services and it
    # sits behind the proxy service, so it depends on all three.
    depends_on:
      - app
      - admin
      - proxy

    # Join the web layer to both the project's default network and its proxy
    # network - see https://github.com/varilink/tools-proxy#readme.
    networks:
      - default
      - proxy

    volumes:
